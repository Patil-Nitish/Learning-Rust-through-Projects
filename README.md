# ü¶Ä Learning Rust Through Projects ![status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-Learning_Rust-ffaa00?style=flat-square)

This repository is a collection of small Rust projects I‚Äôm building as part of my journey to learn the language from scratch.

Each project focuses on a specific concept or feature in Rust ‚Äî from basic syntax to more advanced topics over time.

---

## üéØ Goals

- Learn Rust through hands-on coding  
- Build projects to reinforce each new topic  
- Develop a consistent practice habit  
- Understand Rust by experimenting, failing, and improving  

---

## üóÇÔ∏è Structure

This repository contains multiple small Rust projects, each in its own directory.  
Projects are named based on what they cover or demonstrate (e.g., `guess_number`, `temp_converter`, etc.).

Each project is:

- Self-contained  
- Uses Rust's standard `cargo` project layout  
- Designed to focus on a specific concept or feature

You can explore any folder to see its code and try it out.
