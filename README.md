# 🦀 Learning Rust Through Projects ![status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-Learning_Rust-ffaa00?style=flat-square)

This repository is a collection of small Rust projects I’m building as part of my journey to learn the language from scratch.

Each project focuses on a specific concept or feature in Rust — from basic syntax to more advanced topics over time.

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Learn Rust through hands-on coding  
- Build projects to reinforce each new topic  
- Develop a consistent practice habit  
- Understand Rust by experimenting, failing, and improving  

---

## 🗂️ Structure

This repository contains multiple small Rust projects, each in its own directory.  
Projects are named based on what they cover or demonstrate (e.g., `guess_number`, `temp_converter`, etc.).

Each project is:

- Self-contained  
- Uses Rust's standard `cargo` project layout  
- Designed to focus on a specific concept or feature

You can explore any folder to see its code and try it out.

---

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Install Rust: [https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)  
2. Clone this repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Patil-Nitish/Learning-Rust-through-Projects.git
   cd Learning-Rust-through-Projects
Navigate to a project folder:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd name-of-project
cargo run
📚 Current Projects
<!-- project-list-start -->
🔹 guess_number

🔹 temp_converter

<!-- project-list-end -->
Run ./update_readme.sh after adding a new project to update this list.

📌 Note
This is an open learning journey. Projects range from very simple to progressively more complex over time.
Feel free to explore, learn from, or contribute!

Let me know if you want a **Windows batch script** version instead of a shell script!

Absolutely! Here's your final, clean, and future-proof README.md file with the project list section removed, so you never have to update it manually again:

You can now paste this directly into your `README.md` and leave it untouched while you keep adding projects. Let me know if you'd like it converted to Hindi, styled for GitHub Pages, or auto-generate documentation later.
